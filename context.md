================

We are at a watershed moment in the history of public education. Nineteenth 
century conditions no longer constrain when, where and how learning takes 
place or how we organize our systemâ€”students, teachers, community members, 
facilities and resources.  Current changes and trends are not fads or temporary 
states.  If anything, their effects will magnify over time.  We have a unique 
opportunity and responsibility to address structural challenges in an educational
system that was designed for a very different time.

Additionally, this Strategic Plan is written in the context of political and economic 
factors as well as demographic and social trends. SCCS has gained a reputation for 
excellent schools, and it believes that adoption of this plan will further raise the 
profile and performance of our schools. Our successes to date have resulted in 
continually increasing enrollment (as many young families move to Springboro in 
part based on this reputation), and it is expected that this trend will continue for 
at least the next five years.
