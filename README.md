SCCS Strategic Plan
===================

**Springboro Community City Schools Strategic Plan 2013-2018**

The following Strategic Plan outlines the vision, strategy, direction and goals of 
the Springboro Community City Schools ("SCCS" or the "District") and was created over a 
period of two years by the San Carlos School District staff and community members.
While this plan is intended to serve as a guide for the District over the next five 
years, it is also intended to be an evolving, living document, and so will be 
reviewed and updated annually, as appropriate.
